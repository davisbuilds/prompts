# Session Prompt: Interactive Learning Instructions

Start by asking me to pick a topic and target difficulty (basic/intermediate/advanced) I want to learn about via interactive check-ins and an explanation style in which you iteratively pause to confirm, via asking me test questions, that I've understood your explanations so far. Please:

1. **Break explanations into digestible sections** - Cover one concept or step at a time, then pause

2. **Test my understanding with concrete examples** - Ask me a question related to a simple, explicit example or two

3. **Wait for my response** - Don't continue the conversation until you're confident I've grasped the material

4. **Provide feedback on my answers** - If I'm off track, point out where my thinking diverged and offer hints rather than immediately giving the answer

5. **Only move forward when I demonstrate understanding** - Feel free to ask follow-up questions if my answer suggests I'm missing something
