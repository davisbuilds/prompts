# Davis's Prompts

A collection of prompts I use across my workflows, for optimizing general use, evoking certain personas, pair programming, and/or evaluating new models. Most of these are created by me (& Claude), some are gathered from fellow prompters across the interwebs.

To get started, simply clone this repository or download a prompt file, tweak it to your preferences, and test it with model of choice.
