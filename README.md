# Davis's Prompts

A collection of prompts I use across my workflows, for optimizing general use and/or testing new model releases. Some of these are created by me, others gathered from fellow prompters across the interwebs.

To get started, simply clone this repository and tailor a prompt to your preferences / model of choice.
