## AI Collaboration Guidelines

### Context Management Strategy

**Context Failure Prevention:** To avoid common context issues, this project uses:

- **Context Pruning:** Remove irrelevant information from conversations as they grow
- **Context Quarantine:** Use separate threads for different problem domains
- **Tool Loadout:** Only include relevant tool definitions for the current task
- **Context Summarization:** Compress lengthy discussions into key decisions and outcomes
- **Context Offloading:** Store detailed information in documents rather than conversation context

**Watch for Context Failures:**

- **Context Poisoning:** When errors get repeatedly referenced - immediately correct and document
- **Context Distraction:** When AI over-focuses on conversation history - redirect to current objectives  
- **Context Confusion:** When irrelevant info influences responses - prune unrelated context
- **Context Clash:** When conflicting information exists - resolve contradictions explicitly

### Context Preferences

**Information Gathering:** [How detailed should AI be when asking clarifying questions?]  
**Planning Style:** [Prefer detailed upfront planning vs iterative discovery?]  
**Communication:** [Preferred format for updates, questions, suggestions]

**Context Offloading Scenarios:** Use external documentation/tools when dealing with:

- Tool output analysis that requires careful processing
- Policy-heavy environments with detailed guidelines
- Sequential decision making where mistakes are costly

### Common Patterns

**Effective Approaches:** [What works well with this project/domain]  
**Things to Avoid:** [Known failure modes or approaches that don't work]  
**Handoff Points:** [When to pause for human review/input]

### Session Management

**Start of Session:** [What should AI review first?]  
**End of Session:** [What should be updated/documented?]  
**Knowledge Transfer:** [How to maintain context across sessions]

**Context Hygiene Checklist:**

- [ ] Is all information in this conversation still relevant?
- [ ] Are there any conflicting statements or decisions?
- [ ] Should any detailed information be moved to documentation?
- [ ] Is the conversation focused on current objectives?

"Summarize our key decisions and current focus"
"What information in this context is no longer relevant?" 
"Move detailed specs to documentation and link here"
"Start fresh context - here's what we're working on now"
```

**Note on Context Management:** Effective context management is critical for successful AI-assisted development. Every piece of information in a conversation influences AI behavior - the techniques above help ensure that influence is positive and focused on current objectives. As Breunig notes: "Context is not free" - maintain disciplined information management for best results.
